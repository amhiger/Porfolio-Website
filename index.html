  <h2> I am a pawnbroker/realtor in Fort Lauderdale, beginning my career in software development!</h2>

  <h3> About Me:</h3>
  <p> I have a lot of experience in sales and I also have alot of experience as an entreprenuer. I started my own bitcoin mining company in 2012 and built a mining datacenter with over 30 computers. I had to program all the computers which sparked my interest in coding. Later on, I opened up 3 pawn shops with my business partner. We rented locations, bought a property and built up the pawn shops from nothing. I also have experience selling real estate, alongside my broker Jeff Greenberg, we closed multiple million dollar deals.</p>
